AvP2 Work Archive
=====
When I was younger I used to created maps for the PC game Aliens vs. Predator 2. 

I thought all of this work had been lost; however I managed to dig out all the files from my PC at my parents house. Unfortunately I had a PC crash sometime in late/early 2004-2005, so any work I did before this time period has been lost.
 
This work played a big part in my younger life and I've decided to archive all the work, of value that I could find, on Github so I will always have access to it in future.

This repository contains texture work and `.ed` files for all projects that I worked on from 2005-2009. The files are curated by year of creation.

There are a bunch of projects that I were never completed, so anyone discovering this repository that used to be involved in the AvP2 modding community, feel free to have a browse and build the projects if you wish!
